                <p class="title">How should I care for my pillow... </p>
                <p class="p1"><em>I</em><em>f it’s screen printed?</em></p>
                <p class="p1">The fabric is machine washable in cold water on the gentle cycle and should be dried on low or hung to dry. Both the printed and plain linen used on these designs are not washed prior to sewing but have similar shrink rates. We generally suggest hanging to dry. Colors may fade slightly with washing and direct sunlight. Over time, linen does tend to relax a bit, so if your cover is feeling a little big for your insert we suggest drying it on low heat. High heat can cause the cover to shrink too much.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Iron on medium heat as necessary. If your pillow has a metallic back, please see below.</p>
                <p class="p2"> </p>
                <p class="p1"><em>If it’s hand dyed?</em></p>
                <p class="p1">Our hand dyed and Shibori fabrics are pre-washed and tumble-dried low after dyeing. Repeated washing or prolonged exposure to direct sunlight may cause colors to fade slightly. The plain linen on the reverse of the pillow has not been pre-washed, so we suggest hand washing in cold water and hanging to dry as otherwise there may be shrinkage with the appliqué on the reverse.</p>
                <p class="p1">Iron on medium heat as necessary. If your pillow has a metallic back, please see below.</p>
                <p class="p2"> </p>
                <p class="p1"><em>If it’s digitally printed?</em></p>
                <p class="p1">Our digitally printed fabrics should be spot treated only. The print on these fabrics is a pigment print, which means it sits on top of the fabric versus our screen printed designs which are mostly created with dye which bonds with the fabric.</p>
                <p class="p1">Iron on medium heat as necessary. If your pillow has a metallic back, please see below.</p>
                <p class="p2"> </p>
                <p class="p1"><em>If it’s metallic?</em></p>
                <p class="p1">Please note that our pillows with metallic backs should not be washed, but can be spot treated. The metallic is a foil print and will wear with time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We love a subtle metallic and do think these pillows still look good over time as they fade.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We are working on developing our own woven metallic that should solve this problem.</p>

                <p class="title">What type of insert comes with my pillow?</p>
